# Scientific Text Summarization using BART Documentation


## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of a scientific text summarization project that uses the Hugging Face "scientific_papers" dataset and the BART model for generating abstracts. The project aims to develop a specialized summarization model that can generate concise summaries for scientific texts. The evaluation of the summarization model is done using the ROUGE evaluation metric.

## Project Overview
The scientific text summarization project consists of the following key components:

Dataset Preparation: The project utilizes the "scientific_papers" dataset provided by Hugging Face. This dataset contains scientific articles from various domains, including their abstracts. The dataset is used for training and evaluation purposes.

Model Architecture: The BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model, implemented in the Hugging Face library, is utilized for text summarization. BART is a sequence-to-sequence model that uses a transformer-based architecture and can generate abstractive summaries.

Training: The BART model is trained on the "scientific_papers" dataset using techniques such as tokenization, input encoding, and fine-tuning. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the summarization loss.

Evaluation: The quality of the generated summaries is evaluated using the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metric. ROUGE measures the overlap between the generated summaries and the reference (gold-standard) summaries to assess the summary's effectiveness.

Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the BART model can be deployed to generate summaries for new scientific texts. The deployment process involves input preprocessing, generating summaries using the trained model, and presenting the generated summaries to the end-users.
